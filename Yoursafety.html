     <p><b>INFORMATION FOR GUESTS WITH DISABILITIES</b></P>

     <P><b>Accessible Rooms.</b> Our hotel has rooms with special features for guests with mobility disabilities such as wider doorways, roll-in showers, toilets with grab bars, and more maneuvering space. We also have rooms with visual alarms and notification devices for guests who are deaf or hard of hearing. If you need a room with these features, please contact the front desk to see if any are available.</p>

<p><b>Accessible facilities.</b> Our facilities are designed to be usable by individuals with who use wheelchairs and other mobility devices.</p>

<p><b>Assistance for blind/low vision guests.</b> If you need any written/printed information to be read to you, or would like an orientation of your room or the facilities, please contact the front desk or guest services.</p>


<p><b>Emergency procedures. </b> Please contact the front desk to inquire about what to do in the event of an emergency.</p>

<p><b>Other requests.</b> If you have any other disability-related requests during your stay, we are here to help. Please contact the front desk or our General Manager who is the ADA Contact Person.</p>

<p><b> STEP ONE</b></p>
<p>We’d like to recommend you take just a few minutes to look around and make a mental picture of where fire extinguishers, fire exits, and windows are located. Count how many doors are between your room and the nearest fire exit. Take a moment to review the evacuation plan card on your door. While none of us likes to consider the possibility of a fire, having this information in the back of your mind can be extremely useful in case of a real emergency. A couple of minutes invested in precautions means you’ll be better equipped to help yourself and your loved ones, should the need arise.</p>

<p><b>COMMON SENSE REMINDERS</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Go ahead; lock the door behind you when you come back to your room. In fact, use all the locks we have provided.</li>
  <li>Make sure you know who is on the other side of the door before opening it. If someone unexpected knocks and says he or she is a hotel employee, take a moment to call the front desk and check. If he or she really is an employee, we promise they will not be offended.</li>
  <li>If it’s dark out, use the front entrance of the hotel.</li>
<li>Treat your key card like your car keys. It’s safest in a pocket, wallet, or purse. We also offer in-room safes and a hotel vault for the really valuable stuff.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to speak up. If you see anything at all that seems even a wee bit suspicious, call us. We’d much rather check it out and find out it’s nothing, than have a situation escalate or go unnoticed.</li>
</ul> 

<p><b>SAFETY PROCEDURES: FIRE</b></p>
<p>Fires are fortunately, extremely rare occurrences. And we have a wide range of security measures already in place. But if you see smoke or flames, take immediate action.</p>

<p>Here’s what you need to do: If the fire is in your room, get out right away, close the door behind you, get to the closest fire alarm, and pull the alarm. Don’t take the time to collect your personal belongings. You may waste precious minutes, and the sooner you report the fire, the more likely it is your items will be saved.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you hear a fire alarm, first see if there is smoke in your room. If there is, roll out of bed and crawl along the floor to the door. Because smoke and gasses will rise, the air at the floor is the most fresh.</li>
<li>If there is no smoke, grab your key and head to the door, but don’t open it. While your first instinct will be to flee, fast, it’s important that you first feel the door and handle. You’re looking for heat, which will tell you there may be active flames on the other side. If it’s cool to the touch, open the door slowly, but be ready to slam it shut immediately if you see flames. If there is a fire in the corridor, the safest place for you to be is in your room, behind the door.</li>
<li>If the door is cool, and there are no flames on the other side, look into the corridor. If it’s clear, close your room door and walk to the nearest exit; if you see smoke, get low, stay close to the wall, and crawl to the nearest exit.</li>
<li>Do not use the elevator. It is dangerous for you to use.</li>
<li>Walk down the nearest stairway and try to remain as calm as you can. Holding the handrail will help. If you encounter a lot of smoke in the stairwell, leave the stairway at the nearest floor and find an alternative route out of the hotel.</li>
</ul>
